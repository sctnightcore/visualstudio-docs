# How to: Run unit tests for a containerized app

You can run unit tests with every build of your containerized project by modifying your Dockerfile.

## Prerequisites

- [Docker Desktop](https://hub.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-windows)
- Install [Visual Studio 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/?utm_medium=microsoft&utm_source=docs.microsoft.com&utm_campaign=inline+link&utm_content=download+vs2019)
- Unit tests set up to run using [dotnet test](/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-test)
- Install the [Containers window extension](https://aka.ms/vscontainerspreview)

## Add unit tests to the Dockerfile

Visual Studio does some special performance optimizations before modifying the Dockerfile. When building the **Debug** configuration, Visual Studio builds projects on the local machine, and copies the results to the container. So, only the first stage of the multistage Dockerfile is executed as specified in the Dockerfile. For more information, see [Container Tools build process for Visual Studio](container-build.md).

To add unit tests to a multistage Dockerfile, add a `unit-test` stage to the Dockerfile between the `build` and `publish` stages.

```
FROM build AS unit-test
RUN dotnet unit-test --logger:trx
```

Visual Studio only runs the first stage in **Debug** configuration, so the `unit-test` stage is only run in the **Release** configuration. But even in **Release** configuration, the log results won't be included in the final image, because the final image is built from the `base` stage, not from the `unit-test` stage. To run the tests and produce an image where you can view the logs, use the following command:

```cmd
docker build --target:unit-test
```

## Next steps

You can then use the [Containers window](view-and-diagnose-containers.md) (if you have the extension installed) to view the test logs.  

To view your test logs, use **Ctrl**+**Q** and search for **Containers** to open the **Containers** window. In the **Containers** window, find your container, open the **Files** tab, look for your test results (.trx) file in the container's filesystem, and open it to view the results in Visual Studio.
