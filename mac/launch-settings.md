# launchSettings.json

When developing ASP.NET Core projects, you can configure how your project should be started in development scenarios by customizing the contents of the `launchSettings.json` file. In Visual Studio for Mac, you can update this file by using the Project Options UI or by directly editing the `launchSettings.json` file. This file is the same configuration file that can be used when running Visual Studio on Windows or from the command line using `dotnet`. This file is stored in your project under the `Properties` folder.

For more detailed info, you can go to [Use multiple environments in ASP.NET Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/fundamentals/environments). In this doc, we'll cover how to update this file in Visual Studio for Mac.

## Updating start configuration using Visual Studio for Mac

You can directly edit the `launchSettings.json` in Visual Studio for Mac or you can use Project Options to edit it. To get to the Project Options, right-click your project and select Options. See the image below.

Once you get to this dialog go to Run > Configurations > Default.

There are primarily two things that you'll configure here.

 - Environment variables that are set on start
 - Start URL for the project

## Configure environment variables

You can use the grid to specify values for environment variables. These environment variables will be set when you start your application within Visual Studio for Mac. When developing ASP.NET Core applications, you should be aware of the special `ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT` environment variable. To learn more, see [Use multiple environments in ASP.NET Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/fundamentals/environments).


## Configure start URL

To configure the URL that the application will be launched with go to the ASP.NET Core tab.

![proj options start url](media/vsmac-run-config-default-aspnetcore.png)

Here you can specify the URL(s) that the application will listen on when it's started.
